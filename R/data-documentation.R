#' Soil Taxonomy Hierarchy
#'
#' The first 4 levels of the US Soil Taxonomy hierarchy (soil order, suborder, greatgroup, subgroup), presented as a \code{data.frame} (denormalized) and a \code{list} of unique taxa.
#' @details Ordered based on the unique letter codes denoting taxa from the 13th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.

#' Letter Code Lookup Table for Position of Taxa within the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (12th Edition)
#'
#' A lookup table mapping unique taxonomic Order, Suborder, Great Group and Subgroups to letter codes that denote their logical position within the Keys.
#'
#' @details The lookup table has been corrected to reflect errata that were posted after the print publication of the 12th Edition Keys, as well as typos in the Spanish language edition.

#' World Reference Base for Soil Resources (4th Edition, 2022)
#'
#' A _list_ containing three _data.frame_ elements `"rsg"`, `"pq"`, and `"sq"` providing information on the 'Representative Soil Groups', 'Principal Qualifiers,' and 'Supplementary Qualifiers,' respectively.
#' 
#' @details
#' 
#' Each element has the column `"code"` which is a number (1-32) referring to the position in the Reference Soil Groups, and the column `"reference_soil_group"` which is the corresponding group name. 
#'  - The _data.frame_ `"rsg"` has column `"criteria"`, describing the logical criteria for each Reference Soil Group. 
#'  - The _data.frame_ `"pq"` has qualifier names in column `"principal_qualifier"` and `"sq"` has column `"supplementary_qualifier"`. The `"pq"` and `"sq"` qualifier names may be single qualifiers, or several related qualifiers separated with a forward slash `" / "`
