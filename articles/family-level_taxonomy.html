<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/parse_family.html">parse_family()</a></code> provides a way to separate lower taxonomic levels (“family-level classes”) from the higher taxonomic levels (Order, Suborder, Great Group, and Subgroup) in a soil taxon name.</p>

<span><span class="co">#&gt; 59  This key, like other keys in this taxonomy, is designed in such a way that the reader makes the correct classification by going through the key systematically, starting at the beginning and eliminating one by one all classes that include criteria that do not fit the soil or layer in question. The class or substitute name for each layer within the control section must be determined from the key. If any two layers meet the criteria for strongly contrasting particle-size classes (listed below), the soil is named for that strongly contrasting class. If more than one pair meets the criteria for strongly contrasting classes, the soil is also in an aniso class named for the pair of adjacent classes that contrast most strongly. If the soil has none of the strongly contrasting classes, the weighted average soil materials within the particle-size control section generally determine the class. Exceptions are soils that are not strongly contrasting and that have a substitute class name for one or more parts of the control section. In these soils the class or substitute name of the thickest (cumulative) part within the control section is used to determine the family name.</span></span>

Some mineralogy classes occur or are important only in certain taxa or particle-size classes, and others are important in all particle-size classes. A mineralogy class is assigned to all mineral soils, except for Quartzipsamments.</span></span>

The cation-exchange capacity is determined by NH4 OAc at pH 7 on the fine-earth fraction. The CEC of the organic matter, sand, silt, and clay is included in the determination. The criteria for the classes use ratios of CEC to the percent, by weight, of silicate clay, calculated by weighted average in the control section. In the following classes "clay" excludes clay-size carbonates. Percent carbonate clay must be subtracted from percent total clay before calculating the CEC to clay ratio. If the ratio of percent water retained at 1500 kPa tension to the percentage of measured clay is 0.25 or less or 0.6 or more in half or more of the particle-size control section (or in a part of contrasting families), then the percentage of clay is estimated by the following formula: Clay % = 2.5(% water retained at 1500 kPa tension - % organic carbon).

Temperature class names are used as part of the family name unless the criteria for a higher taxon carry the same limitation. Thus, frigid is implied in all cryic suborders, great groups, and subgroups and would be redundant if used in the names of families within these classes. The Celsius (centigrade) scale is the standard. It is assumed that the temperature is that of a soil that is not being irrigated. Control Section for Soil Temperature The control section for soil temperature is either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at the upper boundary of a root-limiting layer, whichever is shallower. The soil temperature classes, defined in terms of the mean annual soil temperature and the difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures, are determined by the following key.</span></span>
